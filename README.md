# leaflet-challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

To complete the required parts of this challenge, I enlisted examples from class. Additionally, my copy of JavaScript from Beginner to Professional By Laurence Lars Svekis, Maaike van Putten, Codestars By Rob Percival (https://www.packtpub.com/product/javascript-from-beginner-to-professional/9781800562523) for further understanding of the subject in order to complete the challenge. Finally, I enlisted the assistance of the CodePal Code Reviewer (https://codepal.ai/code-reviewer) for assistance in troubleshooting issues that arose.
